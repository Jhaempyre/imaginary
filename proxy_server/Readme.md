Dynamic Image URL Generation (Version 0.x.x)

This initial version focuses on dynamically generating URLs for images, regardless of their format or storage location.
This allows for flexible image serving without hardcoding URLs.
Future Enhancements (Version 1.0.0)

Image Upload: Users will be able to upload images through your application.
Dynamic URL Generation: URLs will continue to be generated dynamically, but with the added functionality of resolving to your own domain.
Image Serving by Own Domain: Images will be stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS) but served directly through your own domain name, providing greater control and potentially improving performance.
Benefits:

Flexibility: Dynamic URL generation facilitates easy image management and integration.
Scalability: The approach can accommodate future growth in image assets.
Performance Optimization: Serving images through your own domain may enhance loading times.
Current Status:

This functionality is under development and targeted for inclusion in Version 1.0.0.

Future Directions:

Additional features and improvements will be considered based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
We're excited to provide you with a robust solution for managing and serving images through your application!
